The Sorting Visualizer project is a web-based tool designed to illustrate various sorting algorithms. It employs HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for its implementation. The included sorting algorithms are Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

Bubble Sort, known for its simplicity, iteratively compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Selection Sort divides the input list into sorted and unsorted sections, repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted section and moving it to the sorted section. Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array incrementally, inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted section.

Merge Sort follows a divide-and-conquer approach, recursively dividing the list into sublists until each sublist contains one element, then merging them back together in sorted order. Quick Sort selects a pivot element, partitions the remaining elements based on the pivot, and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

Each algorithm offers different trade-offs in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and stability, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of sorting techniques. This visualizer serves as an educational resource for studying and comparing sorting algorithms.
